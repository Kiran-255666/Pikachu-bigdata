parquet:
Columnar file format
Efficient compression and encoding schemas
Efficient to work with query based on selected columns
Data and Schema are tied together

Avro:

Data serialiation framework
Language C,C++..
Schema and data Tied Together
Data is compressed in binary format
Schema is written using JSON format
Schema Evolution
Good performance in terms of storage and processing


Gzip compression:

Good compression & Good Speed
Good choice for cold data
When used with RCFiles, Sequence Files,Avro Files,
Gzip provides great compression and speed +splittable component


Snappy Compression:
Medium compression
Very fast in compression & decompression
When we used with sequenceFile, Avro, Parquet file format, 
it can split


bzip2:
Great compression
Very slow in compression and Decompression
Splittable compression codec


lz4 Compression:
medium compression
Fast in compression and Decompression
Better than snappy not as good as bzip2 and Gzip
Recommended
